# Bricks Breaker Game

## Description
This project was given during the course of advanced programming, and its aim was to implement a game, like breaks breaker to make the students understand better the concepts of **object-oriented programming**.
My implementation consists of the following classes for which I wrote simple explanations below.
###Racket
This class is responsible for showing the rocket, preserving its location, and movements.
###Ball
This is the most fundamental class of the program since it controlls the ball's movements and all other actions related them, e.g., scoring and losing.
